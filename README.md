# UFOs Module 11 / UFO sightings with Javascript

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis. 
For this module we built an HTML page that allowed us to pull up information from a javascript(JS) data file using filters on the page---the content within this html file are UFO sightings related. We had to use filters since there were many different sightings that occurred throughout the U.S., such as from different areas or what type of shape of the UFO sightings 

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
As soon as a customer/ website user enters the website, they will see the basic opening with the title, as they scroll down the website they will begin to see all the data and filters that we have ready and set for particular data to be input and searched. 

In the filtered search section, there are 5 different filters to choose from; the date, city, state, country & shape. The customer/ website user will be able to choose any of these filters, then the website will show all of the sightings for that specific search request. Another feature of the website is that multiple filters can be entered, simultaneously, to further inspect the data in the specific search bar that is entered.

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
One drawback is more of a technical/ statistical critique---confirming the amount of individual sightings (how many people viewed them). That might be a helpful bit of information for a UFO enthusiast. One reccomendation for further development is adding a filter for how many individuals witnessed the sightings, and another reccomendation is adding another filter for length of time of these sightings.
